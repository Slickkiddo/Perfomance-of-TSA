This project is to give us an understanding of how Bi-LSTM increases the performance of Time series analysis. Hyper-parameter optimization is also a part of this. ðŸ™‚

The report has the information of how this combination will affect the data analysis along witha a brief explanation of various topics used like bayesian optimization with TPE (SMBO)
